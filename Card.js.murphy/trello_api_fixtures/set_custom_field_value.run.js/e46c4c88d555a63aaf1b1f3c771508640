Link related cards across multiple boards to easily create dependencies, visualize related workstreams, and track overall progress.\n\n**Get more done**  \nJust as there are different ways to finish work, there are different ways to track completion. Choose from three different ways to mark a card as complete:\n\n- Completing all items in a card’s checklist\n- Marking it done via due date\n- Moving a card to a designated ‘Done’ column\n\n![Complete cards and track progress](https://helloepics.com/img/helloepics-completion@2x.3cde70064200611496c0.gif)\n\n**See the big picture**  \nParent cards show how many children have been completed and how many are left. Click on parent cards to dive deeper: see an epic’s completion percentage and which list each child card is in. Navigate intuitively from parent to child and back again.\n\n**Grow your hierarchy**  \nHello Epics works intuitively. Create and attach child cards in three different ways:\n\n- Convert checklist items to child cards\n- Create new child cards directly on the parent\n- Attach existing cards as child cards\n\n![Create new child cards directly from the parent](https://helloepics.com/img/helloepics-attachment@2x.c69028beada85b4d1f7b.gif)\n\n**Seamless integrations**  \nWe’re integrated with two popular power-ups so they work hand in hand with Hello Epics: Agile Tools by Corrello and Card Numbers by Reenhanced. If you have these power-ups installed on your boards, then you’re good to go — there’s no setup needed.\n\n**Protect your data**  \nHello Epics is committed to managing your data securely and transparently. We do not store any of your content — in fact, we never even see it. We will never share your personal information, and we are GDPR compliant.\n\n## Who built Hello Epics?\nWe’re [Substantial](https://substantial.com), a digital product studio headquartered in Seattle. We use Trello on our teams and always wanted easy card relationships to help manage our own projects — so we built it.

is created by experienced project and program managers with input from hundreds of teams that already use this power-up every day to save time, avoid mistakes and get projects done with Trello.\n\n## Plan more effectively\n- Gantt charts will help you to visually plan cards and create dependencies between the cards, also across multiple boards.\n- Use card count, story points or effort to plan your work and understand how the workload is planned by viewing it by member, list, label, milestone or board.\n\n## Track smarter\n- Placker automatically tracks the progress of your cards ( from open to completed) when you move your cards between the lists (or assign labels).\n- We will capture the actual start and end date and calculate the effort spent on a card so you capture exactly how your cards are being completed, without any additional effort.\n\n## Report in real-time\n- Dashboards will tell everything you and your team need to on top of your projects,  which cards are overdue, who has to many open cards or the expected completion date based on your throughput.\n- Create (real-time) dashboards to monitor and report the status of your cards.\n- Customize your dashboard by using a library of widgets that support the Agile, Scrum and traditional project management methodologies.\n\n## For any type of project or process\n- When you work with Agile you can using story points, sprint burndown chart, completion chart, cumulative flow chart and control charts.\n- When you work with Scrum you can  use cycle and lead time trackers, throughput overviews and  time to market.\n- When you work with a more traditional methodology we have the trackers to monitor scope, time, effort, budget and risks.\n\n## Works across and between boards and teams\n- View and combine any number of boards on the Gantt, board or dashboards.\n- Export your data to a spreadsheet or MS project file\n- Import your changes from a excel spreadsheet or Microsoft project file\n- Create card mirrors between boards to keep cards synchronized automatically.\n\n### Add plan attributes to Trello\n![screenshot](https://placker.com/power-up/screenshots/Project-by-placker-overview.png)\n[Read

Here’s how we can help you. \n\nWe love to use Trello to get more done but sometimes, it feels like that the amount of notifications stands in the way of getting things done… Straw was designed to help you overcome notification-overdose. How?\n\n**Straw converts all of the notifications that matter to you into cards and centralizes 📥 them on a single board, so that you may prioritize 🎯 the right tasks and get things done ✅ at the right moment!**\n\n---\n# 🤔 How does it work? \n\n**(1) Choose which Trello board you want to use as your personal productivity board (it may be an existing board, or a new board).**\n\nOnce the Power-Up is installed on the board, a new “🍹INBOX” list is created: this is where you will find your most important Trello notifications, “as a card”  (within a 15 minutes running delay). \n\n**(2) Each card created in your “🍹INBOX” list contains the following information:**\n\n* Who added or mentioned you\n* The content of the notification, in a feed including all previous comments\n* A link to the original card so that you may easily go there and take action.\n\n---\n# ⚠️ Straw only works for the notifications that matter\n\nThese notifications are the ones that **help you work together with your team to achieve your goals**. They must be triggered by someone else than you, on any board but the board you have installed Straw on. \n\n![Straw_Flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20415204/50007083-08194180-ffb0-11e8-9801-50d52a3e1bf0.png)\n\n---\n# ℹ️ FAQ\n\n**How do I complete the workflow of my Straw board?**\n\nStarting with your “🍹INBOX” list, you need to complete your workflow by adding others lists on your board: each list represents a step of your workflow. If you do not have a favorite workflow, you can simply start with three lists: “➡️ TO DO”, “🚧 DOING” and “✅ DONE”.\n\n**Can I add any card manually on my Straw board?**\n\nOf course! You can use your personal productivity board as any regular Trello board and add manually any needed card to remind you of a task.\n\n**What is Straw’s privacy policy?**\n\n[Read Straw’s privacy policy here](https://straw.work/privacy/).\n\n---\n# ✉️ Need help (or want to chat)?\n\nPlease say [hello@straw.work](mailto:hello@straw.work).\n\nAn original 💡 from [Frontier](frontier.team)\n\n![](\"https://ssl.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&t=event&ec=marketplace&ea=view&t=event&tid=UA-125776062-1&z=1545037320&cid=3e792284-9019-e4c6-dc66-0907def4e8ea&dt=TrelloMarketPlace&dp=/trello/market-place\")","overview":"💪 Get more done!
