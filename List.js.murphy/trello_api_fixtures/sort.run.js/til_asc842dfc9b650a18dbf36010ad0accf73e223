You can put anything you want in the description above the Email Template section below.\n\nLeave the words \"Email Template\" in-tact, edit the subject and the email content -- the \"to\" string will automatically be prepended to the content.\n\nWhen you add an item to the Emails checklist, this will be used as the \"to\" string. You can include multiple contacts. It's also useful to note you can copy a bunch of contact names and email addresses out of a spreadsheet and paste them into the checklist to create whole bunch of email cards at once.\n\nThe all caps word NAME will be replaced with the first name of the contact that appears in the checklist item. If more than one contact is used, then any that have names (ie. not just email addresses) will have their first names included, separated by a slash like this:\n\nHi Iain/Mark/Eve,\n\nA new card will be created with the template as the description. Currently, you will still need to open each card and copy/paste the description into a comment -- you can add any cc/bcc you need to (note that Benko Board also allows Auto BCC to be set up).\n\nThe \"to string\" will be left in-tact so you can see who each email was sent to even though they will have the same subject line, and the link to the email card created will be added to the checklist item.\n\nYou can add any other checklists you want to this card. Any attachments on this card will be added as attachments to each of the email cards created -- make sure you include @attach all in the template if you want attachments sent.\n___\nEmail Template\n___\nHere is the subject\n___\nHi NAME,\n\nEmail content goes here.\n\nThanks,\n___","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"email":null,"idBoard":"5b0a731f239d107850fce740","idChecklists":["5c6ceef486507e06c3e5e558"],"idList":"5c3dc1d510f60237d2adc13c","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":701,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[],"idLabels":[],"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Email Templates: instructions in description, copy this card to create a new email template","pos":7,"shortLink":"e9N0OEcA","shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/e9N0OEcA","subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/e9N0OEcA/701-email-templates-instructions-in-description-copy-this-card-to-create-a-new-email-template"}
